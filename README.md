# py-password-project



This is a simple password generator created with Python and has the usage of the random module (as well as other basic libraries). It shouldn't take much effort to download and run tne code so long as you have the proper tools to do so. 

It is pretty self-explanatory if you look at the code and run it. 


I've separated the password generators based on the letters and symbols produced so make sure to watch out for that :)
